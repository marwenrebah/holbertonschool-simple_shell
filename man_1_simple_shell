.SH NAME
shell \- Holberton Simple Shell

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B shell
[\fIfilename\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBshell\fR program is a basic command-line interpreter that emulates fundamental functionalities of a Unix shell. It reads and executes basic commands from user input.

.SH FUNCTIONS
.TP
\fBvoid free_array(char **array)\fR
Frees a dynamically allocated array of strings.

.TP
\fBvoid loop(int input)\fR
Implements the Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL) of the shell.

.TP
\fBint main(void)\fR
The entry point of the shell.

.SH USER INPUT
Upon receiving user input and pressing "Enter," the shell performs the following actions:

1. If in interactive mode, displays the shell prompt ("$ ").
2. Reads a line of input from the user.
3. If the input line is empty or consists of only whitespace characters, goes back to step 1.
4. Tokenizes the input line into an array of words.
5. Calls \fBif_conditions\fR to handle special conditions.
6. If the first word of the command is "env," calls \fBprint_environment\fR and continues to step 1.
7. Checks if the entered command exists in the system's PATH. If not, attempts to execute from a custom path.
8. If the command is not found, displays an error message and goes back to step 1.
9. Executes the identified command.
10. Frees allocated memory and goes back to step 1.

.SH AUTHOR
This version of the Holberton Simple Shell (shell) was developed by [Ezzehi Nour].

.SH BUGS
This version of the shell does not provide definitions for the \fBstr_split\fR, \fBif_conditions\fR, \fBprint_environment\fR, \fBget_path\fR, and \fBexec_command\fR functions. Please refer to the complete implementation for their usage and functionality.
