.SH NAME
hsh \- Holberton Shell	
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B hsh
[command] [options ...]
.SH COPYRIGHT
hsh \- Holberton School's introductory shell project.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B hsh
is a command interpreter that executes commands from the standard input or files.
Designed as a clone of the standard Unix-like shell.
.SH OPTIONS
A simple command consists of optional variable assignments followed by space-separated words and redirections, terminated by a control operator. The first word specifies the command to be executed (argument zero), while the remaining words are passed as arguments to the command.
.PP
The return value of a simple command is its exit status. If the command is terminated by signal n, the return value is 128+n.
.SS
Pipelines
A pipeline is a sequence of one or more commands separated by the control operators | or |&. The format for a pipeline is:
.PP
[command [..ARGS]] [| - |&] [command2 [..ARGS]]
.PP
The standard output of "command" is connected via a pipe to the standard input of "command2". This connection is established before any specified redirections (see REDIRECTION below). If |& is used, the standard error of "command" is also connected to the standard input of "command2" through the pipe; it's a shorthand for 2>&1 |. This implicit redirection of standard error to standard output is performed after any specified redirections.
.SS Lists
A list is a sequence of one or more pipelines separated by operators ;, &, &&, or ||, optionally terminated by ;, &, or <newline>. Operators && and || have equal precedence, followed by ; and &, which also have equal precedence. One or more newlines can appear in a list to delimit commands.
.PP
If a command is terminated by the control operator &, the shell executes it in the background within a subshell. The shell doesn't wait for the command to finish, and the return status is 0. Commands separated by ; are executed sequentially; the shell waits for each command to terminate. The return status is the exit status of the last command executed.
AND and OR lists are sequences of one or more pipelines separated by the && and || control operators, respectively. They're executed with left associativity. An AND list has the form:
.PP
command1 && command2
.PP
command2 is executed if and only if command1 returns an exit status of zero.
.PP
An OR list has the form:
.PP
command1 || command2
.PP
command2 is executed if and only if command1 returns a non-zero exit status. The return status of AND and OR lists is the exit status of the last command executed in the list.
